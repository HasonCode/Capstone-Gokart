# Capstone-Gokart
Assembled an electric gokart for engineering capstone to compete in a local Electrathon competition with eight other schools.
Currently in-progress, working to create a viable kart that can travel the furthest on 1 kWh alongside move the fastest. Going off of a base from THE CRATE assembly, I worked with a partner to create a solid base utilizing a 36 V motor and motor controller, driven by lead-acid batteries.

Planned developments leading up to the competition, planned modifications include:
- Cart extension to support both myself and my partner in driving
- Lithium-ion battery installation
- Increase to 48 V setup with motor and motor controller
- Lengthened sprocket
- Exterior paneling with designs submitted from community
- Aerodynamic design implementation
